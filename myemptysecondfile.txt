The above image shows the user interface of my repository from other contributors. We can see the fork option at the top
right corner of the repository page. By clicking on that, the forking process will start. It will take a while to make a 
copy of the project for other users. After the forking completed, a copy of the repository will be copied to your GitHub 
account. It will not affect the original repository. We can freely make changes and then create a pull request for the 
main project. The owner of the project will see your suggestion and decide whether he wants to merge the changes or not.
